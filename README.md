		Programming
		Q1. Reverse singly linked list, with O(n) space complexity and O(n) time complexity

		Programming
		Q2. You are given with a 1D array of height of towers of a 2D world, 
		    consider all towers are adjacent to one another, in the same order as specified the input array
		    When it rains, water is collected on top of the towers, if the adjacent towers or their 
		    neighbouring towers are actually taller than itself
		    Identify the total water which can be collected

		Programming
		Q3. Given with a origin coordinate (x, y), and a stream of coordinates 
		    coming in [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3) ...], identify the nearest n coordinates from the origin

		Analysis
		Q4. Given with any traversal out of :- PreOrder / InOrder / PostOrder
		    Will it represent a Binary Tree, none, or many ?
